You need the file "decimate_data.ipynb" and the file "Convolutional filter.ipynb".
First clean the point cloud in a program like cloud compare, get rid of obvious noise.
Then run the cleaned up point cloud through "decimate_data.ipynb" with the desired scale of decimation.
Run the resulting .csv through "Convolutional filter.ipynb" to locate local depressions and height increases.
